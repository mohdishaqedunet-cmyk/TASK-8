# TASK-8
The dataset is first loaded and explored to identify features that influence customer subscription behavior. Missing values and “unknown” categories are cleaned, and inconsistent text entries are standardized to ensure data quality. All categorical variables are then converted into numerical form using encoding techniques so they can be used by the model. The data is split into training and testing sets with a fixed random state for consistent evaluation. A Decision Tree Classifier is trained with a limited maximum depth to prevent overfitting, and the tree is visualized to clearly understand how decisions are made. Predictions on the test data are evaluated using a classification report, and training accuracy is compared with testing accuracy to detect overfitting. Finally, key decision rules are extracted from the tree to explain the main factors that drive customer subscription behavior.
